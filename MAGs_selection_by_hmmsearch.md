## curation the output of hmmsearch 

#based on PFAM, TIGR, and Kofamscan, also compared to DRAMOUT

```
the Hmmsearch based on PFAM and KOfamscan is more conserve then DRAMOUT since w
we applied GA, TC and length filtering, similar to JIG pipline,
KOfamscan also has interal creteria, 

Also compare to DRAMOUT

```

#1 fccB and sqr share conserved domain
```
part overlapp, 
fccB (PF09242, PF07992, PF10518)
sqr (07992);

#sorA is based on KOfamscan (K05301), however, it is overlap with fccB and sqr
#problem with sorA K05301

```
